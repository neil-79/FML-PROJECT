üîç Key Findings
Through our analysis, we observed that certain features consistently play a significant role in determining a song's popularity across all eras:

Loudness: Songs with higher loudness levels are more likely to attract attention and achieve popularity.
Genre: The genre of a song remains a crucial determinant, influencing its reach and audience preference.
Duration: The length of a song has a notable impact, as optimal duration varies based on trends over time.
Harmonic Simplicity: Simpler harmonic structures often resonate better with listeners, enhancing a song's appeal.
Additionally, all acoustic features analyzed (e.g., energy, danceability, and valence) were found to be important contributors to song popularity, highlighting the intricate relationship between musical elements and listener engagement.

These insights provide valuable guidance for music producers and industry professionals aiming to craft successful tracks.
